Letter Non-Embedded prints on letter size paper without embedded fonts.

The non-embedded types use the Helvetica and Times fonts.  If you feel your users will not have these fonts on their computer, or if your language uses characters or symbols that are not accommodated by the Helvetica and Times fonts, then choose an embedded type.  The embedded types use the Dejavusans and Dejavuserif fonts.  This will make the pdf files rather large; thus it is not recommended to use an embedded type unless you must.

New type folders can be added to the newcertificate/type folder. The name of the folder and any new language strings for the new type must be added to the newcertificate language file.';
